## [Unreleased][unreleased]

## [0.1.18] - 2016-10-20
- Validate that statements do not contain fragment cycles
- Validate that fragments are on composite types
- Make validation robust to order (can now reference types declared later in a statement or schema)
- Validate unique variable, operation, input type, fragment, and argument names
- Validate provided non-null arguments
- Validate unused variables and fragments
- Validate known directives
- Validate lone anonymous operation
- Validate variables in allowed positions (works for direct union and interface references, not for nested)
- Dynamically process validation CATs.  Extend validate function to take explicit visitor functions for testing.
- Fix bug in list type specs
- Validate scalar leafs
- Make compatible with spec backport for users of Clojure < 1.9.0

## [0.1.17] - 2016-10-14
- Implement preliminary version of FieldsOnCorrectType validation
- Build a map from namespaced spec keyword to their corresponding nodes
- Include full parent node in each child node (for getting to parent types)
- Validate argument, type, and fragment names
- Validate that variables are input types
- Fix required field argument issue

## [0.1.16] - 2016-10-12
### BREAKING
- [BREAKING] Change resolver to 3-parameter function

### CHANGED
- Pass existing validation CATs (including error messages, mostly, code is still overly complex), including valid and invalid examples
- Namespace schema (and statement variable) types for global spec naming
- Define specs at the end after walking the entire tree (rather than as we go). Support validation of recursive object types.
- Support whitespace at the beginning / end of a schema or statement
- Extra eval protection for defining specs only
- Simplify approach to optional vs. required
- Support types for nested lists, including required
- Split schema and statement validation into 2 passes each - one for resolving specs, two for validation rules using them
- Add a defnodevisitor macro to operate exclusively on nodes of a certain type
- Fix some invalid schema scenarios
- Support required for scalars (but not yet for other types)

## [0.1.15] - 2016-10-11
- Fix aliasing. By Marcin Kulik (sickill).
- Add test for default argument value. By Marcin Kulik (sickill).

## [0.1.14] - 2016-10-10
- Enhance introspection query for arguments and __type
- Only enforce required field arguments
- Support argument default value (#11)
- Handle introspection required type

## [0.1.13] - 2016-10-10
- Return errors under :errors key. By Marcin Kulik (sickill)
- Rename ambiguous `:name` to `:type-name`, `:variable-name`, and `:argument-name` in the appropriate context
- Avoid ambiguity between `BooleanValue` and `EnumValue`
- Reduce code duplication and increase consistency after the parse transform step
- Modify grammar to simplify parser
- Move to a consistent parse tree tracking the type of the node.  Use a vector of maps instead of a single map with multiple key value pairs.
- Fix `:ListType` parsing
- Remove `:enum-value` wrapping key for enum values passed as arguments
- Remove `{:selection { :field }}` wrappers for `:selection-set`
- Preliminary implementation of validation
- Fix introspection query
- Changed from Clojure 1.8.0 to Clojure 1.9.0-alpha12

## [0.1.12] - 2016-09-27
###Changed
- Make `TypeFields`/`InputTypeFields` one to many with `TypeField`/`InputTypeField`
- `TypeFieldArgument` now supports enums
- Resolve name collision between `EnumValue` and `EnumIntValue`
- Change the parsed data structure to a key-value map for `TypeFields`, `InputTypeFields`, and `VariableDefinitions`
- Update parser for variable name
- Unwrap `:type-field-type` for list type for consistency
- Rename ambiguous `:name` to `:type-name` in the context of named types

## [0.1.11] - 2016-09-26
### Changed
- Fix test cases

## [0.1.10] - 2016-09-26
### Added
- Introspection

- Rename render, formatting. By Edward Wible (aew)
- Fix bug in required type field type. By Edward Wible (aew)
- Simplify parsed representation for argument to be keys and values in a map. By Edward Wible (aew)
